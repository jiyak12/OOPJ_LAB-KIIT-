## ðŸ’» List of Programs

### 1. `prog1` Box Volume Calculator
- **Description:** Defines a class `Box` with three data members: `length`, `width`, and `height`. Includes a method `volume()` to calculate the volume. The `Demo` class creates an object of `Box` with user inputs and displays the volume.
- **Input:** length, width, height  
- **Output:** Volume of the box

### 2.`prog2` Rectangle Area and Perimeter
- **Description:** Defines a class `Rectangle` with data members `length` and `breadth`. Contains methods to read inputs, calculate area and perimeter, and display results. Uses a parameterized constructor to initialize values.
- **Input:** length, breadth  
- **Output:** Area and perimeter of the rectangle

### 3. `prog3` Student Details and Lowest CGPA
- **Description:** Manages details of `n` students, including roll number, name, and CGPA. Displays all student details and identifies the student with the lowest CGPA.
- **Input:** Roll No, Name, CGPA of `n` students  
- **Output:** Details of all students and name of student with lowest CGPA

### 4. `prog4` Method Overloading - Subtract Methods
- **Description:** Demonstrates method overloading by implementing multiple `subtract` methods with different parameters. The driver class calls these methods and displays the results.
- **Input:** Various parameter values for subtraction  
- **Output:** Subtraction results based on different method signatures

### 5. `prog5` Area Calculation by Method Overloading
- **Description:** Overloads the `area()` method to calculate and display the area of a circle, triangle, and square based on user choice and dimensions.
- **Input:** Dimensions such as radius, base, height, and side  
- **Output:** Area of circle, triangle, or square as selected

### 6. `prog6` Constructor Overloading for Rectangle Area
- **Description:** Uses constructor overloading to calculate the area of a rectangle. Default constructor initializes length and breadth to zero, while the parameterized constructor initializes them based on user input.
- **Input:** length and breadth (optional)  
- **Output:** Area of the rectangle
